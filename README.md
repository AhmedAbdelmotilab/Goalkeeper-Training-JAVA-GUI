# Goalkeeper-Training-JAVA-GUI
Write  a Concurrent Java  program  which  illustrates  an  emulated 
training  of  a  football  goalkeeper.  There  is  one  goalkeeper  and  4 
players shooting at him. Each is running in a separate thread. The 
training proceeds as follows:
1) The players take turns in shooting. Player 1 starts, followed by 
Player 2. Next is Player 3 and then Player 4. And they start over 
again with Player 1, and so on.
2) Each player starts the shot by moving to a random location, at 
which a new ball is created. The player shoots the ball at the 
goalkeeper, who tries to catch it. The ball is shot with a random 
speed. The ball is directed towards a random point in the goal.
3) The next player may only shoot after either the previous player 
scores a goal, or the goalkeeper succeeds in catching the ball. In 
either case, the shot ball disappears.
The training continues until your application is terminated by the 
user. At this point, all threads must be correctly terminated.
Your project may be implemented on the command line interface 
(CLI).
